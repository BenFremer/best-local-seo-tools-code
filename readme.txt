== Description ==

The Best Local SEO Tools plugin aids a website's local seo in a variety of ways. In one way, a Local Portfolio is made that incorporates information from an enormous geographic data API which at gigabytes of size is unfeasible to include in the plugin. As servers cost money, beyond 25 free visits to the portfolio from SEO per month are capped from this service, but more can be purchased with a subscription at http://www.bestlocalseotools.com, along with other powerful premium features in the premium version of the plugin. Data requests to and from the plugin / your website to the geographic data API are performed as you use the plugin or as website users view code rendered through the plugin.
